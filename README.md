This is a repo for IOC's related to the "Clickfix" social engineering campaign, including variations of information stealers that are delivered via this method. New IOC's should be added weekly if not daily, broken out by months.

The campaign leverages legitimate looking CAPTCHA pages in order to trick users into following the commands and running malicious code on their systems, ultimately leading to maliciuos payloads being downloaded and executed. By aggregating IOC's related to this campaign, my hope is to enable practitioners to hunt within thier own environement and report sites hosting these types of attacks.
